This project is a React + Vite prototype for document intelligence. Use modern React (hooks, functional components), Material UI, and mock Azure Document Intelligence and Translator API responses. UI should include a split screen: left for image preview (with highlight overlays), right for OCR and translation tabs. Include a file drop area and a process button.
