# ADX Token Caching Fix

## Problem
The Angular frontend was prompting users to log in repeatedly when clicking on sessions. This was happening because:

1. **No Token Caching**: The `getADXAccessToken()` method was acquiring a new token on every call
2. **Aggressive Token Acquisition**: The `AuthInterceptor` was calling `getADXAccessToken()` on every API request to `/agents` endpoints
3. **Interactive Prompts**: When silent token acquisition failed, the system was immediately falling back to interactive prompts with `consent` mode

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Token Caching in AuthService
- Added `cachedADXToken` and `adxTokenExpiry` properties to cache tokens
- Tokens are cached with a 5-minute safety buffer before expiry
- Added `adxTokenAcquisitionInProgress` flag to prevent concurrent token requests

### 2. Smarter Token Acquisition
- **Silent First**: Always try silent token acquisition first
- **Selective Interactive**: Only attempt interactive authentication for recoverable errors
- **Reduced Prompts**: Use `select_account` instead of `consent` to reduce login prompts
- **Error Handling**: Added `shouldRetryInteractive()` to check if errors are recoverable

### 3. Proactive Token Loading
- When user logs in, proactively acquire ADX token in background
- Added `preloadADXToken()` method called from `updateAuthState()`
- This ensures tokens are available when needed without blocking user actions

### 4. Optimized Auth Interceptor
- More selective about when to request ADX tokens
- Only adds `X-ADX-Token` header for requests that actually need it
- Prevents unnecessary token acquisition on every API call

### 5. Token Management Methods
- `refreshADXToken()`: Manually refresh expired tokens
- `hasValidADXToken()`: Check if cached token is still valid
- Clear cached tokens on logout

## Key Changes Made

### `src/app/services/auth.service.ts`
- Added token caching properties
- Enhanced `getADXAccessToken()` with caching logic
- Added proactive token loading
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Added token management utilities

### `src/app/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts`
- Made ADX token acquisition more selective
- Only request ADX tokens for endpoints that need them
- Reduced unnecessary token requests

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **First Login**: User logs in once, ADX token is acquired proactively
2. **Session Clicks**: Use cached token, no additional prompts
3. **Token Expiry**: Silent refresh when possible, minimal interactive prompts
4. **Error Recovery**: Smart retry logic for recoverable authentication errors

## Testing
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Token caching logic implemented
- ✅ Selective token acquisition in place
- ✅ Proactive token loading configured

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix with real user interactions
2. Monitor console logs for token acquisition patterns
3. Verify that ADX queries use user tokens correctly
4. Ensure smooth user experience with minimal login prompts
